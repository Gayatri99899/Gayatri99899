🔍 About Me

I'm Gayatri Patil — a Civil Engineering graduate who transitioned into the IT world out of passion for Cloud Computing and Linux System Administration. I’m a self-motivated learner with strong curiosity and discipline, focused on mastering DevOps and system engineering tools.

- 💻 Proficient in Linux (Ubuntu, Debian): users, permissions, services, processes, package management  
- ☁️ Hands-on experience with core AWS services:  
  EC2, S3, IAM, VPC, EBS, EFS, CloudWatch, CloudTrail, CloudFront, MFA, SNS, Lambda  
- 🚀 Deployed Django, Node.js, and static HTML websites on AWS EC2 instances  
- 📈 Built Linux monitoring solutions using Prometheus & Grafana  
- 🛡️ Practiced creating a basic Security Operations Center using Wazuh for log monitoring and threat detection

I am actively seeking opportunities in Cloud Engineering, Linux Administration, or DevOps Support roles where I can contribute my skills, learn from real-world systems, and grow into a skilled IT engineer.
